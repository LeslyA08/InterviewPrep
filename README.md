# InterviewPrep
So as part of our preparation for interviews coming up we are going to be sending you topics each day that we would like you to prepare in. For the task we would like you to create a GitHub repository that will be the home of your prep. Please share the link with us so we can see you daily progress. In the repo we would like you to create a README.md that will be your glossary. Please follow the follow format for the prep:
