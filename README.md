# InterviewPrep
So as part of our preparation for interviews coming up we are going to be sending you topics each day that we would like you to prepare in. For the task we would like you to create a GitHub repository that will be the home of your prep. Please share the link with us so we can see you daily progress. In the repo we would like you to create a README.md that will be your glossary. Please follow the follow format for the prep:
Repo Created
A section per topic and three parts to each section
Explanation of topic / concept in your own words
Explanation of what you created with that tool / concept
Detail of the benefit to using the this tool / concept
Make this look really good with MARKDOWN  Add links to your code if you have examples.
Todays Topics

### H3 Cloud & DevOps

##### H5 Explanation:
-Cloud is several servers put together where someone can store information. These servers are physically located elsewhere so the user does not have to store anything on their own computer.
-DevOps aim is the shorten production time of a product. It is a combination of developemnent and operations.

##### H5 What I created:

##### H5 Benefits:
Cloud: Users and businesses don't have to pay for servers and maintenance. They are able to pay a lower cost for someone else to keep their data in another location and provide enough space for backups.
DevOps: Better quality of products and increased efficiency.

### H3 CICD

##### H5 Explanation:
-the practice of using automation to test, build, integrate, and deploy new code with minimal human oversight, to facilitate velocity through frequent releases of small component of applications, rather than periodic releases of monolithic code changes

##### H5 What I created:
Created a pipeline to Jenkins that automatically runs when pushed to github.

##### H5 Benefits:
-Increased velocity, improved stability, less likelihood of major bugs, less operational overhead, automated rollback reduces cost of bad deployments

### H3 Jenkins

##### H5 Explanation:
-Jenkins is a program used with CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment.

##### H5 What I created:
Created a pipeline that automatically tests once things are pushed to github.

##### H5 Benefits:
-Not only is Jenkins widely used, it also makes running CICD pipelines easier.

### H3 Provisioning

##### H5 Explanation:
-Provisioning is to automate your commands. Instead of typing it in manually, you add them all to a file that runs and automatically installs software you need and runs through the commands you specify.

##### H5 What I created:
-made provisioning scripts to run a vagrant machine.

##### H5 Benefits:
-Provisioning helps automate things. You don't have to type in the same commands over and over everytime you make a change.

### H3 Networking

##### H5 Explanation:
-what makes it possible for computers and other devices to communicate with each other.

##### H5 What I created:
-Used public IP addresses to connect virtual machines to ec2 instances.

##### H5 Benefits:

### H3 Principle of Least Privilege

##### H5 Explanation:
-This is a concept that lets users only have the privileges they are required to do their jobs and nothing more.

##### H5 What I created:

##### H5 Benefits:
-This helps not give any users permissions to change anything they shouldn't. We don't want users being able to see things they shouldn't.

### H3 IAC

##### H5 Explanation:
-Infrastructure as code: the practice of representing IT infrastructure configuration as code, for the purpose of managing the deployment and provisioning of IT systems

##### H5 What I created:

##### H5 Benefits:
-Scalability, reliability, aids in change of management

### H3 Packer and Terraform

##### H5 Explanation:
-Packer is an open source tool to create images.
-Terraform is an IaC tool that uses readable code to start up other software like mysql. 

##### H5 What I created:
-Created an image using packer.
-Created a mysql database using Terraform.

##### H5 Benefits:
-Terraform's code is reusable so you don't have to retype everything everytime.
-Packer deploys images that are provisioned and configured.
